                    I'm Zach Rasavanh, an aspiring <b>computer engineer</b> with focus areas in software development and information security. I attend Iowa State University and am on pace to graduate in <b>December, 2013</b>.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I have technical work experience from a number of companies in the industry including <b>Northrop Grumman</b> and <b>Shazam</b> doing software development and product management. My goal is to create products that change and affect the way we interact with the world.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    My passion is to advance the technology in the <b>living room</b>. Particularly, I want to change the way we watch and view TV, the way we entertain ourselves, and the way we entertain our guests. I believe there is a vastly untouched market for a modern home entertainment experience and I plan on being a part of the war for the living room.
                    <br/>

                    Aside from the serious stuff, I play a lot of music, love ultimate frisbee, like long walks on the beach, and enjoy eating out.

                <h4><font color="red">PhotoQuest</font></h4>
                PhotoQuest is an Android app that a few classmates and I made to solve the problem of reverse image searching. Imagine being able to take a picture of any object, press a button, and receive information about that item. It's  like Googling but for pictures.

                <h4><font color="red">AI and Embedded Systems iRobot</font></h4>
                I was the team lead on the project and managed the tasks of each memember as well as made sure we met all of the requirements. We used C to manipulate IR and Sonar data to create a map of the surroundings and navigate our robot around an obstacle course.

                <h4><font color="red">Pipe-Lined Processor Design</font></h4>
                Our design implements the MIPS instruction set. We used VHDL to virtualize the machine and run test benchmarks. This was a semester long project that caused many sleepless nights and large consumptions of caffeine. The design worked perfectly and we ended up getting 100% on the whole thing!

                I am working on a set-top box for modern television sets that uses an existing cable stream and represents it in an attractive and interactive manner. Without giving too much away, my box will change the way people interact with their entertainment and will create a unique home experience that no competitor is reaching.

                I was an intern during the summer of 2012 in a <b>software development</b> role. As a software developer I fixed bugs and implemented new features for later versions of the Joint Targetting Toolbox that we were working on. By the end of the summer, I had solved every bug assigned to me, redesigned the graphical interface, and implemented a full section of the Target Data Matrix.

                I interned at Shazam during the Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 semesters in the Corporate Security department. My job was to develop security software, manage databases and systems, and implement simple penetration tests on networks.I was the <b>project manager</b> for all of my software projects. These ranged from in-house apps to web applications.
